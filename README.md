## üöÄ Quick Start

Getting started with your own personal RSS reader is as simple as 1-2-3.

### 1. Create Your Own Copy

Click the **"Use this template"** button to create your own copy of this repository.

### 2. Add Your Favorite Feeds

Create a file named `feeds.opml` and add the RSS feeds you want to follow. You can use `rss.opml.template` as a starting point.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages & Actions

1.  Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages** and set the source to **"GitHub Actions"**.
2.  Go to the **"Actions"** tab and click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them."**

That's it! Your personal RSS reader will be built and deployed automatically. You can find it at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

## üé® Customization

Once you have your reader up and running, you can personalize it to make it your own.

### Personalize Your Reader

Create a `config.json` file (you can copy `config.json.template`) to change your site's title, description, and how often it updates.

### Change the Look and Feel

Create a `static/custom.css` file to add your own styles and completely change the appearance of your reader.

### Format Your Feeds File

If your `feeds.opml` file gets messy, you can automatically format it by running the "Format OPML File" workflow in the Actions tab of your repository.

## ü§ù The Spirit of Sharing

`lovelyRSS` is more than just a tool; it's an invitation to a more open and decentralized way of sharing information. By sharing your reading list, you are helping to build a more connected and curious web. 

### How to Follow a Friend

You don't have to subscribe to every feed your friend follows. Instead, you can subscribe to their `latest_rss.xml` feed. This single feed contains the latest posts from all of their subscriptions, making it easy to see what they're reading without overwhelming your own reader.

We encourage you to share your reader with your friends and on your social media. Let's build a more open web together!
