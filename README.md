# Personal RSS Reader


ðŸ”— **Live Demo**: [https://kabiraj404.github.io/free](https://kabiraj404.github.io/free)


Date: 2025/09/12. Still working on it. After desperate attempt to clone multiple github based RSS, finally this seems working. After trying to customize six different similar RSS reade, this seems working. 
I loved his style [pesarkhobeeee.github.io/rss](https://pesarkhobeee.github.io/rss/) but wanted more minimalist approach. 

Task to do next:
Update the RSS,
Improve the interface
