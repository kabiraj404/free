Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation. With this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into the Digital Disruption with Geoff Nielson (https://www.youtube.com/@InfoTechRG) Discover how technology is reshaping our lives and livelihoods.

Establish meaningful community health metrics and participatory evaluation frameworks. Partner with product and advocacy teams to co-design community pathways around Mozilla’s initiatives — from participatory datasets to prosocial tech campaigns.

      <title>The Python Migration That Took Years | Behind Meta’s tech transition</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJByWKOcW24</link>
      <description>Lisa Roach led one of the largest Python migrations in the world, transitioning Meta (formerly Facebook) from Python 2 to Python 3. In this behind-the-scenes interview, she shares how a seemingly straightforward technical task became a two-year saga involving custom tooling and company-wide campaigns. This story is about both the technical and people challenges that come with modernising code at scale.

      <title>Executives should be the least busy people</title>
      <link>https://world.hey.com/dhh/executives-should-be-the-least-busy-people-bb94fb18</link>
      <description>If your executive calendar is packed back to back, you have no room for fires, customers, or serendipities. You've traded all your availability for efficiency. That's a bad deal.Executives of old used to know this! That's what the long lunches, early escapes to the golf course, and reading the paper at work were all about. A great fictional example of this is Bert Cooper from Mad Men. He knew his value was largely in his network. He didn't have to grind every minute of every day to prove otherwise. His function was to leap into action when the critical occasion arose or decision needed to be made.But modern executives are so insecure about seeming busy 24/7 that they'll wreck their business trying to prove it. Trying to outwork everyone. Sacrificing themselves thin so they can run a squirrel-brain operation that's constantly chasing every nutty idea.Now someone is inevitably going to say "but what about Elon!!". He's actually a perfect illustration of doing this right, actually. Even if he works 100-hour weeks, he's the CEO of 3 companies, has a Diablo IV addiction, and keeps a busy tweeting schedule too. In all of that, I'd be surprised if there was more than 20-30h per company per week on average. And your boss is not Elon.Wide open calendars should not be seen as lazy, but as intentional availability. It's time we brought them back into vogue.</description>

These threats continue to challenge web developers, making robust ReactJS security practices essential. ReactJS offers some built-in and automatic measures against XSS. However, securing ReactJS applications requires a deeper understanding and implementation of advanced security techniques. This presentation is tailored for developers eager to enhance their security skills in ReactJS. In this session, we will delve into a range of critical security topics with a focus on defensive coding techniques to secure your ReactJS applications effectively. Topics covered include: • Navigating the Security Landscape of React Components • Decoding React's Built-in XSS Protections • The Intricacies of Props and Types • A Closer Look at dangerouslySetInnerHTML • Understanding User-submitted URLs in React • Enhancing React Security with CSS Styled-Components • The Dynamics of JSON and React Integration • The Power of Lazy Loading and Access Control in React • Exploring React Template Injection Vulnerabilities • The Role of Server-Side Rendering in React Security This session is designed to expand your ReactJS knowledge, strengthen your security strategies, and give you exact methods to help you build safer, more robust ReactJS applications. Join us to master advanced defense techniques and contribute to the development of secure ReactJS applications!

      <title>He saved OpenAI, invented the “Like” button, and built Google Maps: Bret Taylor (Sierra)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImgGtnNbx0</link>
      <description>Bret Taylor’s legendary career includes being CTO of Meta, co-CEO of Salesforce, chairman of the board at OpenAI (yes, during that drama), co-creating both Google Maps and the Like button, and founding three companies. Today he’s the founder and CEO of Sierra, an AI agent company transforming customer service. He’s one of the few people I’ve met who’s been wildly successful at every level—from engineer to C-suite executive to founder—and across almost every discipline, including PM, engineer, CTO, COO, CPO, CEO, and board member. *In this conversation, you’ll learn:* 1. The brutal product review that nearly ended his Google career—and how that failure led to creating Google Maps 2. The question Sheryl Sandberg taught him to ask every morning (“What’s the most impactful thing I can do today?”) that transformed how he approached every role 3. The three AI market segments that matter 4. Why AI agents will replace SaaS products 5. His framework for knowing whose advice to actually listen to—and how that came in handy during the OpenAI board drama 6. The counterintuitive go-to-market strategy most AI startups get wrong 7. Sierra’s outcome-based pricing model that’s transforming how enterprise software is sold (and why every SaaS company should adopt it) 8. What he’s teaching his kids about AI that every parent should know *Brought to you by:* CodeRabbit—Cut code review time and bugs in half.

      <title>Ray Dalio Explains Money Vs Credit</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-GmQKbVW_r8</link>
      <description>In an advanced economy, credit does more good than bad. But it’s important to remember that borrowing creates cycles — and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. I explain why this is particularly important today in my new book, How Countries Go Broke. But if you’d like more context on how all of these pieces come together, I recommend you watch my 30-minute explainer “How the Economic Machine Works” here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&amp;t=1444s #principles #howcountriesgobroke #economics #credit</description>
